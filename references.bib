Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONInterindividual clinical variability is vast in humans infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), ranging from silent infection to rapid death. Three risk factors for life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia have been identified—being male, being elderly, or having other medical conditions—but these risk factors cannot explain why critical disease remains relatively rare in any given epidemiological group. Given the rising toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of morbidity and mortality, understanding the causes and mechanisms of life-threatening COVID-19 is crucial.
RATIONALEB cell autoimmune infectious phenocopies of three inborn errors of cytokine immunity exist, in which neutralizing autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (mycobacterial disease), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (staphylococcal disease), and IL-17A and IL-17F (mucocutaneous candidiasis) mimic the clinical phenotypes of germline mutations of the genes that encode the corresponding cytokines or receptors. Human inborn errors of type I IFNs underlie severe viral respiratory diseases. Neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs, which have been found in patients with a few underlying noninfectious conditions, have not been unequivocally shown to underlie severe viral infections. While searching for inborn errors of type I IFN immunity in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, we also tested the hypothesis that neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs may underlie critical COVID-19. We searched for auto-Abs against type I IFNs in 987 patients hospitalized for life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia, 663 asymptomatic or mildly affected individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 1227 healthy controls from whom samples were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTSAt least 101 of 987 patients (10.2\%) with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia had neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) auto-Abs against IFN-ω (13 patients), against the 13 types of IFN-α (36), or against both (52) at the onset of critical disease; a few also had auto-Abs against the other three individual type I IFNs. These auto-Abs neutralize high concentrations of the corresponding type I IFNs, including their ability to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Moreover, all of the patients tested had low or undetectable serum IFN-α levels during acute disease. These auto-Abs were present before infection in the patients tested and were absent from 663 individuals with asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection (P {\textless} 10−16). They were present in only 4 of 1227 (0.33\%) healthy individuals (P {\textless} 10−16) before the pandemic. The patients with auto-Abs were 25 to 87 years old (half were over 65) and of various ancestries. Notably, 95 of the 101 patients with auto-Abs were men (94\%).
CONCLUSIONA B cell autoimmune phenocopy of inborn errors of type I IFN immunity accounts for life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in at least 2.6\% of women and 12.5\% of men. In these patients, adaptive autoimmunity impairs innate and intrinsic antiviral immunity. These findings provide a first explanation for the excess of men among patients with life-threatening COVID-19 and the increase in risk with age. They also provide a means of identifying individuals at risk of developing life-threatening COVID-19 and ensuring their enrolment in vaccine trials. Finally, they pave the way for prevention and treatment, including plasmapheresis, plasmablast depletion, and recombinant type I IFNs not targeted by the auto-Abs (e.g., IFN-β). {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/370/6515/eabd4585/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Neutralizing auto-Abs to type I IFNs underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia.We tested the hypothesis that neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs may underlie critical COVID-19 by impairing the binding of type I IFNs to their receptor and the activation of the downstream responsive pathway.

            Anti-cytokine autoantibodies may cause immunodeficiency and have been recently recognized as ‘autoimmune phenocopies of primary immunodeficiencies’ and are found in particular, but not exclusively in adult patients. By blocking the cytokine’s biological function, patients with anti-cytokine autoantibodies may present with a similar clinical phenotype as the related inborn genetic disorders. So far, autoantibodies to interferon (IFN)-γ, GM-CSF, to a group of TH-17 cytokines and to IL-6 have been found to be causative or closely associated with susceptibility to infection. This review compares infectious diseases associated with anti-cytokine autoantibodies with primary immunodeficiencies affecting similar cytokines or related pathways.},

The auto-Abs against IL-17A were neutralizing in the only patient tested, as shown by bioassays of IL-17A activity. None of the 37 healthy controls and none of the 103 patients with other autoimmune disorders tested had such auto-Abs. None of the patients with APS-I had auto-Abs against cytokines previously shown to cause other well-defined clinical syndromes in other patients (IL-6, interferon [IFN]-γ, or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor) or against other cytokines (IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12, IL-18, IL-21, IL-23, IL-26, IFN-β, tumor necrosis factor [α], or transforming growth factor β).

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONClinical outcomes of human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection range from silent infection to lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Epidemiological studies have identified three risk factors for severe disease: being male, being elderly, and having other medical conditions. However, interindividual clinical variability remains huge in each demographic category. Discovering the root cause and detailed molecular, cellular, and tissue- and body-level mechanisms underlying life-threatening COVID-19 is of the utmost biological and medical importance.
RATIONALEWe established the COVID Human Genetic Effort (www.covidhge.com) to test the general hypothesis that life-threatening COVID-19 in some or most patients may be caused by monogenic inborn errors of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 with incomplete or complete penetrance. We sequenced the exome or genome of 659 patients of various ancestries with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia and 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. We tested the specific hypothesis that inborn errors of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)– and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)–dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity that underlie life-threatening influenza pneumonia also underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. We considered three loci identified as mutated in patients with life-threatening influenza: TLR3, IRF7, and IRF9. We also considered 10 loci mutated in patients with other viral illnesses but directly connected to the three core genes conferring influenza susceptibility: TICAM1/TRIF, UNC93B1, TRAF3, TBK1, IRF3, and NEMO/IKBKG from the TLR3-dependent type I IFN induction pathway, and IFNAR1, IFNAR2, STAT1, and STAT2 from the IRF7- and IRF9-dependent type I IFN amplification pathway. Finally, we considered various modes of inheritance at these 13 loci.
RESULTSWe found an enrichment in variants predicted to be loss-of-function (pLOF), with a minor allele frequency {\textless}0.001, at the 13 candidate loci in the 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to the 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection (P = 0.01). Experimental tests for all 118 rare nonsynonymous variants (including both pLOF and other variants) of these 13 genes found in patients with critical disease identified 23 patients (3.5\%), aged 17 to 77 years, carrying 24 deleterious variants of eight genes. These variants underlie autosomal-recessive (AR) deficiencies (IRF7 and IFNAR1) and autosomal-dominant (AD) deficiencies (TLR3, UNC93B1, TICAM1, TBK1, IRF3, IRF7, IFNAR1, and IFNAR2) in four and 19 patients, respectively. These patients had never been hospitalized for other life-threatening viral illness. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells from IRF7-deficient patients produced no type I IFN on infection with SARS-CoV-2, and TLR3−/−, TLR3+/−, IRF7−/−, and IFNAR1−/− fibroblasts were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.
CONCLUSIONAt least 3.5\% of patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia had known (AR IRF7 and IFNAR1 deficiencies or AD TLR3, TICAM1, TBK1, and IRF3 deficiencies) or new (AD UNC93B1, IRF7, IFNAR1, and IFNAR2 deficiencies) genetic defects at eight of the 13 candidate loci involved in the TLR3- and IRF7-dependent induction and amplification of type I IFNs. This discovery reveals essential roles for both the double-stranded RNA sensor TLR3 and type I IFN cell-intrinsic immunity in the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Type I IFN administration may be of therapeutic benefit in selected patients, at least early in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/370/6515/eabd4570/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN production and amplification underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia.Molecules in red are encoded by core genes, deleterious variants of which underlie critical influenza pneumonia with incomplete penetrance, and deleterious variants of genes encoding biochemically related molecules in blue underlie other viral illnesses. Molecules represented in bold are encoded by genes with variants that also underlie critical COVID-19 pneumonia.
Clinical outcome upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ranges from silent infection to lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We have found an enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)– and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)–dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally defined LOF variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies in 23 patients (3.5\%) 17 to 77 years of age. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this circuit are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection.

            Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with a wide range of clinical manifestations, including autoimmune features and autoantibody production. We developed three different protein arrays to measure hallmark IgG autoantibodies associated with Connective Tissue Diseases (CTDs), Anti-Cytokine Antibodies (ACA), and anti-viral antibody responses in 147 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in three different centers. Autoantibodies were identified in approximately 50\% of patients, but in {\textless}15\% of healthy controls. When present, autoantibodies largely targeted autoantigens associated with rare disorders such as myositis, systemic sclerosis and CTD overlap syndromes. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) were observed in ∼25\% of patients. Patients with autoantibodies tended to demonstrate one or a few specificities whereas ACA were even more prevalent, and patients often had antibodies to multiple cytokines. Rare patients were identified with IgG antibodies against angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2). A subset of autoantibodies and ACA developed
            de novo
            following SARS-CoV-2 infection while others were transient. Autoantibodies tracked with longitudinal development of IgG antibodies that recognized SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins such as S1, S2, M, N and a subset of non-structural proteins, but not proteins from influenza, seasonal coronaviruses or other pathogenic viruses. COVID-19 patients with one or more autoantibodies tended to have higher levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Nonstructural Protein 1 (NSP1) and Methyltransferase (ME). We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 causes development of new-onset IgG autoantibodies in a significant proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and are positively correlated with immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins.},

        , Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC). The infection is highly contagious, has a high mortality rate, and its pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Pulmonary inflammation with substantial lung damage together with generalized immune dysregulation are major components of COVID-19 pathogenesis. The former component, lung damage, seems to be at least in part a consequence of immune dysregulation. Indeed, studies have revealed that immune alteration is not merely an association, as it might occur in systemic infections, but, very likely, the core pathogenic element of COVID-19. In addition, precise management of immune response in COVID-19, i.e. enhancing anti-viral immunity while inhibiting systemic inflammation, may be key to successful treatment. Herein, we have reviewed current evidence related to different aspects of COVID-19 immunology, including innate and adaptive immune responses against the virus and mechanisms of virus-induced immune dysregulation. Considering that current antiviral therapies are chiefly experimental, strategies to do immunotherapy for the management of disease have also been reviewed. Understanding immunology of COVID-19 is important in developing effective therapies as well as diagnostic, and prophylactic strategies for this disease.},

Along with IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, IL-2 shares the common cytokine receptor γ chain, γc, which is mutated in humans with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. Herein, we primarily focus on the recently discovered complex roles of IL-2 in broadly modulating T cells for T helper cell differentiation. IL-2 does not specify the type of Th differentiation that occurs; instead, IL-2 modulates expression of receptors for other cytokines and transcription factors, thereby either promoting or inhibiting cytokine cascades that correlate with each Th differentiation state. In this fashion, IL-2 can prime and potentially maintain Th1 and Th2 differentiation as well as expand such populations of cells, whereas it inhibits Th17 differentiation but also can expand Th17 cells.}

ABSTRACT={Background: Cases of excessive neutrophil counts in the blood in severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients have drawn significant attention. Neutrophil infiltration was also noted on the pathological findings from autopsies. It is urgent to clarify the pathogenesis of neutrophils leading to severe pneumonia in COVID-19.Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 55 COVID-19 patients classified as mild (n = 22), moderate (n = 25), and severe (n = 8) according to the Guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China. Trends relating leukocyte counts and lungs examined by chest CT scan were quantified by Bayesian inference. Transcriptional signatures of host immune cells of four COVID19 patients were analyzed by RNA sequencing of lung specimens and BALF.Results: Neutrophilia occurred in 6 of 8 severe patients at 7–19 days after symptom onset, coinciding with lesion progression. Increasing neutrophil counts paralleled lesion CT values (slope: 0.8 and 0.3–1.2), reflecting neutrophilia-induced lung injury in severe patients. Transcriptome analysis revealed that neutrophil activation was correlated with 17 neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)-associated genes in COVID-19 patients, which was related to innate immunity and interacted with T/NK/B cells, as supported by a protein–protein interaction network analysis.Conclusion: Excessive neutrophils and associated NETs could explain the pathogenesis of lung injury in COVID-19 pneumonia.}

The visualization tool also displays shared and exclusive protein regions for genes with multiple splice variants. A genome-wide analysis demonstrates that antigens for approximately 80\% of the human protein-coding genes can be selected with this strategy.},

            SARS-CoV-2 may pose an occupational health risk to healthcare workers. Here, we report the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, self-reported symptoms and occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers at a large acute care hospital in Sweden. The seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 19.1\% among the 2149 healthcare workers recruited between April 14th and May 8th 2020, which was higher than the reported regional seroprevalence during the same time period. Symptoms associated with seroprevalence were anosmia (odds ratio (OR) 28.4, 95\% CI 20.6–39.5) and ageusia (OR 19.2, 95\% CI 14.3–26.1). Seroprevalence was also associated with patient contact (OR 2.9, 95\% CI 1.9–4.5) and covid-19 patient contact (OR 3.3, 95\% CI 2.2–5.3). These findings imply an occupational risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers. Continued measures are warranted to assure healthcare workers safety and reduce transmission from healthcare workers to patients and to the community.},

            Current SARS-CoV-2 serological assays generate discrepant results, and the longitudinal characteristics of antibodies targeting various antigens after asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 are yet to be established. This longitudinal cohort study including 1965 healthcare workers, of which 381 participants exhibited antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen at study inclusion, reveal that these antibodies remain detectable in most participants, 96\%, at least four months post infection, despite having had no or mild symptoms. Virus neutralization capacity was confirmed by microneutralization assay in 91\% of study participants at least four months post infection. Contrary to antibodies targeting the spike protein, antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein were only detected in 80\% of previously anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive healthcare workers. Both anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG levels were significantly higher in previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients four months post infection than in healthcare workers four months post infection (p=2*10
            −23
            and 2*10
            −13
            respectively). Although the magnitude of humoral response was associated with disease severity, our findings support a durable and functional humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 infection even after no or mild symptoms. We further demonstrate differences in antibody kinetics depending on the antigen, arguing against the use of the nucleocapsid protein as target antigen in population-based SARS-CoV-2 serological surveys.},

            The Ensembl project (https://www.ensembl.org) annotates genomes and disseminates genomic data for vertebrate species. We create detailed and comprehensive annotation of gene structures, regulatory elements and variants, and enable comparative genomics by inferring the evolutionary history of genes and genomes. Our integrated genomic data are made available in a variety of ways, including genome browsers, search interfaces, specialist tools such as the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor, download files and programmatic interfaces. Here, we present recent Ensembl developments including two new website portals. Ensembl Rapid Release (http://rapid.ensembl.org) is designed to provide core tools and services for genomes as soon as possible and has been deployed to support large biodiversity sequencing projects. Our SARS-CoV-2 genome browser (https://covid-19.ensembl.org) integrates our own annotation with publicly available genomic data from numerous sources to facilitate the use of genomics in the international scientific response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also report on other updates to our annotation resources, tools and services. All Ensembl data and software are freely available without restriction.},
